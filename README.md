##📊 Power BI Project: Sales and Profit Analysis for XYZ Company (2012 - 2015) 🚀##

#🔍 Problem Statement
XYZ Company executives needed a comprehensive overview of their sales and profit performance from 2012 to 2015. The goal was to analyze key metrics including profit by region, top products, and sales insights to inform strategic decisions.

#💡 Solution

Product Insights: Top and Bottom 5 Products by Sales: Identified which products contributed most and least to sales.
Top 5 Products by Profit: Highlighted the most profitable products.
Customer Insights: Top 10 Customers by Sales: Showcased the customers who generated the highest sales revenue.
Regional Analysis: Profit by Region: Analyzed profit distribution across different regions.
Sales and Profit by Market: Visualized sales and profit performance across various market segments.
Operational Metrics: Average Delivery Days: Measured the average time taken for product deliveries.
Total Return Orders: Analyzed the total number of return orders to identify trends.
